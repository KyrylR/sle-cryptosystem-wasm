# SLE Cryptosystem

The object of the research is the process of symmetric encryption of information based on algebraic structures of finite rings and systems of linear equations.

The subject of the work is the development of a symmetric cryptosystem that uses surjective mappings between rings and affine transformations to ensure data protection.

The aim of the work is the creation, theoretical justification, and software implementation of a symmetric cryptosystem that uses surjective mappings between rings and affine transformations to ensure data protection.

The work employs methods of theoretical analysis of algebraic structures, combinatorics of mappings, construction and study of algorithms, and computer modeling.  
The software implementation is carried out in Rust using standard libraries for linear algebra and modular arithmetic, as well as the integrated RustRover IDE for related tasks.

As a result, the GEN-G algorithm for generating finite rings and isomorphisms was developed, a protocol for symmetric encryption/decryption with multi-level data obfuscation was described and implemented, a theoretical analysis of resistance was conducted, and a software library for ring generation, basic operations, encryption, and decryption was created.  
The possibilities of applying the system in verifiable computations with zero-knowledge proofs were explored.

The developed software product can be implemented for symmetric data encryption in cases where the parties can securely agree on a shared key, as well as in resource-constrained devices (IoT, smart cards).  
Thanks to its algebraic structure, the system is promising for use in verifiable computations and zero-knowledge protocols.
